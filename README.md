## Description

The _AI Text Improver_ app is a handy Flutter application that allows you to enhance your text messages by providing various tones such as casual, formal, friendly, and more. It leverages the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) as a service to offer you improved versions of your text.
